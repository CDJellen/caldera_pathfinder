# CALDERA&trade; Pathfinder
A CALDERA plugin developed by the Center For Threat-Informed Defense to enable CALDERA to intelligently leverage vulnerability scan data in its operations. With Pathfinder, CALDERA can demonstrate how an adversary might use vulnerabilities in your environment to achieve their goals, highlighting a path through your network and showing the real impact of a vulnerability.  

###### map network vulnerabilities, plan network attacks

## Overview
Pathfinder seeks to extend the CALDERA automated adversary emulation platform to support automated ingestion of network scanning tool output for CALDERA to analyze and execute against. The principal objective of the project is to extend CALDERA to allow a user to do the following:
1. Run a scan of a target network or system
2. Upload the scan results to a running instance of CALDERA
3. Use the ingested results to draw out potential attack paths CALDERA could notionally take
4. Create workflows so that CALDERA can follow the actual attack paths and execute a real attack
